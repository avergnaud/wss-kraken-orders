## Ask

An order listed on the sell side of the order book

## Bid

An order listed on the buy side of the order book 

## Bid/Ask Depth

The Bid/Ask Depth represents the cumulative volume of buy and sell orders at a particular price. The bid depth at a given price is the cumulative volume of current buy orders on the book at that price or higher, while the ask depth at a given price is the cumulative volume of current sell orders on the book at that price or lower.


## Bid/Ask Spread

The difference in price between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the order book.

The bid/ask spread chart available for Kraken markets only shows the spread between the highest limit buy order and the lowest limit sell order (plotted over time). A market order will fill in this gap if there are matching market orders of the opposing type sufficient to fill it. Otherwise it will fill, at least in part, using limit orders of the opposing type.
